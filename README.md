# BrainTumorTest_CNN
This is one of my University Projects using Convolutional Neural Network. I downloaded the image dataset from Kaggle. After building the CNN model, I deployed it using Python, and flask. I also used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to create a user interface, and MySQL to maintain the database of the project.
